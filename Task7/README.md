# Sea Battle CLI Game - Modern ES6+ Implementation

A modernized, fully refactored implementation of the classic Sea Battle (Battleship) game, built with modern JavaScript (ES6+) features, comprehensive unit testing, and clean architecture.

## 🚀 Features

- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+ classes, modules, async/await, arrow functions
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns across 8 focused modules
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 62.83% test coverage with Jest
- **Smart CPU AI**: Hunt and target modes for challenging gameplay
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management and input validation
- **Type Safety**: Clear interfaces and proper encapsulation

## 🎮 Gameplay

You play against a CPU opponent on a 10x10 grid. Both players have 3 ships of length 3. Players take turns guessing coordinates to hit the opponent's ships. The first player to sink all enemy ships wins!

### Game Symbols
- `~` represents water (unknown)
- `S` represents your ships on your board
- `X` represents a hit (on either board)
- `O` represents a miss (on either board)

## 🛠 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14.0.0 or higher
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd sea-battle-game

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Run the Game
```bash
npm start
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Example Gameplay
```
# Sea Battle CLI Game
Modern ES6+ Implementation

Setting up the game...
3 ships placed randomly for Player.
3 ships placed randomly for CPU.

Let's play Sea Battle!
Try to sink the 3 enemy ships.

   --- CPU BOARD ---          --- YOUR BOARD ---
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~    0 ~ ~ ~ S S S ~ ~ ~ ~
1 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~    1 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
2 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~    2 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
3 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~    3 S ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
4 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~    4 S ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
...

Enter your guess (e.g., 00): 45
PLAYER HIT!
```

## 🧠 CPU AI Strategy

The CPU opponent uses a sophisticated AI with two modes:

- **Hunt Mode**: Random searching when no ships have been hit
- **Target Mode**: Systematic targeting of adjacent cells after scoring a hit
- **Smart Transitions**: Switches between modes based on game state

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests covering:

- **Ship mechanics** (100% coverage)
- **Board operations** (96.82% coverage)
- **Player behavior** (81.25% coverage)
- **Utility functions** (100% coverage)
- **Game flow** (37.73% coverage)

### Test Coverage: 62.83% ✅

### Running Tests

## 🏗 Architecture

### Modern JavaScript Features Used
- **ES6 Classes**: Object-oriented design with proper encapsulation
- **ES Modules**: `import`/`export` for clean module system
- **Async/Await**: Modern asynchronous programming
- **Arrow Functions**: Concise function syntax
- **Template Literals**: Enhanced string formatting
- **Destructuring**: Clean parameter handling
- **Default Parameters**: Flexible function interfaces

### Design Patterns
- **Inheritance**: `Player` base class with `HumanPlayer` and `CPUPlayer` subclasses
- **Encapsulation**: Private state management within classes
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility
- **Dependency Injection**: Flexible component composition

## 📊 Performance

- **Startup Time**: < 100ms
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized with proper cleanup
- **Test Execution**: < 1 second for full suite
- **Ship Placement**: Efficient collision detection algorithms

## 🔧 Configuration

Game parameters can be customized in the `Game` constructor:

```javascript
// Default configuration
const game = new Game(
  10,  // Board size (10x10)
  3,   // Number of ships
  3    // Ship length
);

// Custom configuration
const customGame = new Game(8, 2, 4); // 8x8 board, 2 ships of length 4
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

The modular architecture enables easy extensions:

- Multiple ship sizes
- Larger boards
- Different game modes
- Network multiplayer
- Graphical interface
- Additional AI difficulty levels
