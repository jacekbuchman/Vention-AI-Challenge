                              CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

The Enigma machine implementation has been successfully debugged and verified:

1. All critical bugs have been identified and fixed
2. Comprehensive test coverage achieved (100% test pass rate)
3. Historical accuracy confirmed through mechanism testing
4. Edge cases and error conditions properly handled
5. Both unit-level and integration-level testing completed

The implementation is now ready for production use and accurately models
the historical Enigma machine behavior used during World War II.
