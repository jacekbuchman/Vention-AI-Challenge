Act as a database architecture consultant. Analyze these social media app requirements step by step:

1. Core Requirements
   - Must handle 10M+ users
   - Data types: User profiles (JSON), posts (text/media), follower networks
   - Performance: 80% read / 20% write operations. 
   - It must support high data read speed.
   - Scalability: Linear scaling with user growth

2. Analysis Process
   a) Identify key data relationships
   b) Map read/write patterns to database strengths
   c) Evaluate scalability mechanisms
   d) Compare database types (document vs. graph vs. relational vs. hybrid)

3. Reasoning Guidance
   - For each requirement category:
      - "First, consider [specific aspect] because..."
      - "This suggests [database type] would be suitable due to..."
      - "However, potential limitations include..."
   - Use comparative phrases: "While X excels at Y, Z offers better performance for..."
   - Conclude with: "Therefore, the optimal choice is... because..."

4. Expected Output Format
   - Bulleted reasoning chain
   - Final recommendation with technical justification
